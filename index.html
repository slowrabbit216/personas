        <h1>Personas Storyboard</h1>
        <p>
          I wanted to explore an interface that students on campus use regularly
          and understand it better. I will do this by observing real users
          interacting with an interface, interview these individuals about their
          experiences, create personas based on these users, and illustrate a
          storyboard for one of my personas.The interface that I chose was the
          check-in kiosk outside the mail room that students use to pick up
          packages.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 1: Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          For the first part, I will observe and interview people while they're
          interacting with an interface - this method is called a contextual
          inquriy. To do this I have created a list of interview questions that
          can hopefully solicit users to talk mroe about the interface from
          their perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The questions I have prepared are: <br></br>What led you here today?
          <br></br>Do you ever have concerns or difficulties while using the
          interface?
          <br></br>Do your needs ever change after interacting with the
          interface?
          <br></br>How would you describe the process of checking into the
          mailroom to your grandparents?
          <br></br>Does this interface satisfy your needs?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also created a sketch for my interface that shows its key
          components
        </p>
        <div class = "gallery-container">
          <img src="./sketch.jpeg" height="500rem" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The key components of the interface include an ID card scanner which
          is attached to a touchscreen that has an input bar. The interface
          allows students to check if they have packages using their ID card and
          to pick them up if they want. The interface also helps relay
          information to the MailRoom staff by telling them what packages they
          need to find.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 2: Recording Observations</h2>
        <p>
          I observed 3 people using the interface I chose and recorded my
          findings. I tried my best to make objective observations about their
          actions and not let my opinions influence what I recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observations: The users begin by finding their ID card and swiping it
          on the scanner before they touch the screen. Some users struggled to
          have their ID’s scanned correctly by the scanner and had to move to a
          different kiosk. After the ID is scanned the students see a screen
          that tells them what packages they have and they press the “Pickup
          Now” button on the screen. Most students go to the waiting room before
          they see the next screen which is a confirmation. All students seem
          familiar with the interface and only operate it for 5-10 seconds.
          Students whose ID didn’t scan on the first time seemed to know what
          the problem was and could troubleshoot themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I interview the users and recorded their responses. I summarize
          my findings by each question.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. What led you here today?</b>
          <br></br>All students had similar responses to question 1 which was to
          come to the mailroom because they had mail. They didn’t specify how
          they knew they had mail though.
          <br></br>
          <b>
            2. Do you ever have concerns or difficulties while using the
            interface?
          </b>
          <br></br>Majority of the students reported that they typically didn’t
          have trouble with using the interface. However, they proceed to say
          that either themselves or others have had trouble operating the
          scanner and making sure the system registered their ID. They also
          mentioned that this problem causes inconvenience either for themselves
          or others and can also increase wait times. One student mentioned that
          sometimes they are concerned someone else might use their ID but
          pointed out that when the screen moves on they feel safe.
          <br></br>
          <b>3.Do your needs change after interacting with the interface?</b>
          Majority of students responded that their original goals do not change
          even after using the interface. One student mentioned that sometimes
          they have letter mail but it doesn’t show up so they have to ask the
          staff members to retrieve it.
          <br></br>
          <b>
            4.How would you describe the process of checking into the mailroom
            to your grandparents?
          </b>
          <br></br>The focus of students' response to this question was focused
          around their ID card. One student said they would describe it as
          swiping a credit card. After swiping students didn’t go into detail of
          how to confirm picking up the packages but they do mention that
          confirmation is required. One student also mentioned that they would
          explain that everyone needs to wait for their name to be called.
          <br></br>
          <b>5.Does this interface satisfy your needs?</b>
          <br></br>Majority of students responded that the interface satisfied
          their needs with the exception of one student who had to switch to a
          different kiosk because their ID wasn’t being read.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 3: Personas</h2>
        <p>
          For the third part I took the data that I collected from my observations 
          and interview to create 2 personas. They are based on overarching trends 
          that I observe amongst all the users I interviewed.

        <h2>Part 4: Storyboards</h2>
        <p>
          For the fourth part I created a storyboard for the persona "Amy" that I 
          creatred. The storyboard reflects the user's journey from start to end.
